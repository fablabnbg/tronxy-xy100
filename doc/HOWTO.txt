#
# Additional resources:
# - Reserve table space of ca. 0.8m x 1.4m
# - Have a plate for spreading out the contents of the pack of screws and nuts. 
# - Have a second small plate for collecting the screws and nuts for each step.
# - A tipped knive, safer if blunt.
# - pointed pair of pliers for holding nuts. Especially also the ring on the power jack.

-> The acrylic parts are all covered on both sides with adhesive paper.
   This needs to be peeled off. A tipped knive is very helpful to get moving at one corner.
   The small flat screwdriver also works.
 
-> Step 2: There are two switches with short leads, one with long leads. Used a short one.

-> Step 4: There may be some acrylic dirt attached to the inside of the Motor
   Holder. Scrape this off with a knive.
   Do not tighten the 'Motor Holder' without assembling the motor
   There should be a hole in the 'Motor Holder', so that the screw beneath can be reached.

-> Step 6: In Parts required: 'Smooth Rod x2' should say 'Smooth Rod (shortest) x2' 
   This is only mentioned later, causing a needless moment of confusion.
   
-> Step 7: Orient the motor connectors under the longer side of the acrylic pieces.

-> Step 8: In Parts Required: Left stepper motor should mention '(A)', right motor '(B)'

-> Step 9: Use the limit switch with the long leads.

-> Do step 13 before step 12. The power jack assembles much more easily while the back is separate.

-> Step 13: The threaded rods used here are longer than the lead screws. Their tracks are sharper, 
   but same pitch as those of the lead screws (not 'thinner'). 

-> Step 15: The wider side should be on the left, near the Z-limit switch.
   Expect the 3D printed spanner to be spent, after being used here.

-> Step 19: The thicker and longer rods are 28.5cm long.

-> Step 20: preassemble the lead screws into the bronce metal parts. 
   They might have a very tight initial fit. Remove again.
   The bronce metal parts might be mounted slanted. Loosen their screws.

-> Step 21: There is nothing that holds against the force of the X-belt. Ouch.
   Rod caps on the printed part are missing!
   5) Feed back through the bottom gap of the ---acrylic--- +++3d printed+++ piece.

-> Step 22: The screws on the PCB cannot be tightened without bending the board. 
   Washers and spacers needed! The 3x 25mm screws need spacers too!
   The buttons must not protrude from the acrylic board more than 1mm, or they get hit by the printhead.
   The display must be flush with the acrylic board, or the bowden tube gets caught.

-> Step 23: The two holes in the acrylic side have bad tolerances. 
   The lower holes should go up by 1mm.
   The screen plate should be 2cm further back, so that the teflon tube can move freely in front.
   The teflon tube should be 10cm longer.

-> Step 25: no sunk space for screw head in bed.
   The long end of the bed points iwards.

-> Step 27: 'over the top' means over the top of the hot end, but below the display bridge.
   Fix the black wrapped cable trunk to the hot end with one of the white pieces, fix it to the frame 
   with another. 
   14. Take yourself time to really tidy up the cables.
