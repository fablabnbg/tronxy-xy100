Description from Thingiverse:
2017-04-24 - Ran the part through NetFabb to fix some minor issues.

For those of you making the Startt printer from iMakr or the TronXY XY-100, you probably found that the 3D printed parts that came with your kit were not printed with the most care. Some other people have designed and posted various replacement parts that you can print yourself, but no one seemed to have posted the fan shroud, even though it was requested in the forums.

So here is my version of the fan shroud that came with my Startt kit from iMakr.

You can also find a number of redesigned parts here:
